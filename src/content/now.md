## Professional

I am in a sabbatical leave for 6 months with my current company [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai) since September 2025. I'm coming back on the 2nd of March 2026, with a new role. I aim to be more an individual contributor than in the past, as my role grew organically and was a mix of a lot of different responsabilities. I will still be based in Paris and plan to come often to the office to meet all the great people I work with.

## Personal

We have been traveling Europe by train with my girlfriend since last September, and it's been a blast so far. We've been to a lot of different countries and learned a lot about European culture and history. We were in Spain since the beginning of the year, and decided to come back to Paris this week as there were train accidents there.

We'll look for a flat soon and try to build our space, as well as progress on other cool projects that we've been thinking about during our trip.

### Tech / Entrepreneurship

During our trip, I've been working a bit on the side on ideas that I had for a long time or needs that we had during our trip. I especially worked on [Tracktrip](https://tracktrip.app), a web application to track expenses during a travel, that we used ourselves.

I also started to work on this website, my personal one. I had a personal website more than 10 years ago, and wanted to have one again for quite some time now.

During the development of Tracktrip I also created a few libraries like [trpc-db-collection](https://github.com/fuegoio/trpc-db-collection) to share bits of codes I found useful to others.

Finally, I started recently to work on an old idea of mine: discover new repositories easily on Github. I did some design on Figma 3 years ago but did not have the time nor the motivation to code it, but now thanks to AI and _vibecoding_, it was way more pleasant to go back to it and prototype something quickly. It's called [Gitradar](https://gitradar.dev) and it's not working well right now, but I'm gonna work on it.

### Creative

My sabbatical was also the opportunity to try more creative activities, something I've always been interested in. Maybe visiting every art museum of Europe did inspire me. This website is an example of something I wanted to try, with a more bold and personal identity.

I also bought an embroidery machine to start manufacturing t-shirts with cool designs of my own making. Especially, I would like to create a pinball themed brand as I've kind of fallen (again) in passion for it during our travel in Europe.

It's really nice to make something physical out of my hands.

### Games

As stated earlier, we had the opportunity during our travel to play in a lot of arcades. Those brought back a lot of memories, as we had a pinball machine at home with my family when I was 4 or 5. We had the opportunity to play a lot of pinball, sometimes by paying for each game, but often paying for entry only. We played old EM, old SS, newer SS and modern Stern games, and it was a life changing experience for me. I knew in the back of my head that I would like someday to have a pinball at home, but playing it during our trip actually made it a priority for me.

We've also played detective games with my girlfriend like _Séance at the Blake Manor_ or _The Case of the Golden Idol_ and it's been wonderful as well. We both love those type of games and they play really nice during a travel.

### Sport

We have been to the gym quite often during our trip and really want to keep this a good habit.

### Travel

Well we've been traveling quite a lot the past 5 months, but I do know that I would like in the future to go on more nature trips. It was a bit cold during those months, and therefore we were a bit limited on this side. I would like to plan for our next holidays a bit of backpacking with sleepover material or a bit of bikepacking.

### Housing

As initially said, we will be looking for a flat in Paris. Additionaly, we would like to find a house in the countryside to have some space to build cool things. Building spaces like an arcade bar, a pool, a cool kitchen, ... is something totally different as living in a flat in Paris, and we would like to build this together with my girlfriend.
